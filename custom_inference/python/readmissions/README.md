# Custom Model Examples

This folder includes various examples of custom models using the well known  `Hospital Readmissions` dataset. There are three examples (Level 1 - 3) with each level presenting a more complicated example of custom model than the one previously to it.

In the `custom.py` scripts, we use all of the available hook functions including the `fit` function. This means that these examples can be used as both `custom inference` and `custom training` models. To see the difference between the two, check the official DataRobot-Drum package documentation in GitHub [here](https://github.com/datarobot/datarobot-user-models)

If you try to upload the models in DataRobot using the UI, make sure to choose `Scikit-Learn Drop in` environment. Lastly, make sure you upload the items saved inside `custom_model` folder and not the custom folder itself.

## Creating environment
The easiest way to create an environment to both train and test these models with drum, would be to execute the below commands after you install conda.

`conda create --name your-env-name python=3.7.0`
`conda activate your-env-name`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Readmission_level_1

*High Level Overview:*

1. Fit a CatBoost classifier on top of the `Hospital Readmissions` dataset.
2. `custom.py` script needs to include Null value handling.
3. `custom.py` script needs to search for keyword `Diabetes|diabetes` in `diag_1_desc` column and create a new Boolean column.

#### Readmission_level_2

*High Level Overview:*

1. Preprocess Data using scikit-learn pipeline
2. Fit XGboost model on the data
3. `custom.py` script needs to preprocess using the scikit-learn pipeline 
4. `custom.py` script needs to score using the XGboost Model.

The extra difficulty here is that we need to define where DRUM is to find both of the preprocessing and the keras model in order for this custom model to work.

#### Readmission_level_3

The biostatisticians at ABC labs have a legacy model that they are using to predict probability to be readmitted into the hospital. They found that using an ensemble model between their own and the keras model, yields the best outcome. The result needs to be the average probability between the two models.

*High Level Overview:*

1. Preprocess Data using scikit-learn pipeline
2. Fit XGboost model on the data
3. `custom.py` script needs to preprocess using the scikit-learn pipeline 
4. `custom.py` script needs to score using the XGboost Model.
4. `custom.py` script needs to return the average probability as calculated from XGboost + legacy model.
